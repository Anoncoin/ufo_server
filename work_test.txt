what should the rules be for testing users?

for each user, keep track of:
    number of times they have passed the test work
    the next work they will be tested with
        store ufoIndex and the factor index
    factors this user has found (not the indexes but the actual numbers)
    probability that they should be tested (checked when anyone else finds a factor)

for each factor found, keep track of:
    time it was found
    who found it
    what the sigma and B1 were (and obviously what ufoIndex)

when a new factor is found:
    validate it!
        this has the side-effect of making sure that another user did not find the factor
    ensure that it's in "factors this user has found"
    for each user (except for the finder):
        update "the next work they will be tested with" (see above)

when a user gets work:
    //
