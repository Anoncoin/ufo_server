what should the rules be for testing users?

for each user, keep track of:
    number of times they have passed the test work
    the next work they will be tested with
        store ufoIndex and the factor index
    factors they have found! (not the indexes but the actual numbers)

for each factor found, keep track of:
    time it was found
    who found it
    what the sigma and B1 were (and obviously what ufoIndex)

when a new factor is found:
    validate it!
    for each nick (except for the finder):
        update "the next work they will be tested with" (see above)

when a user gets work:
    //
